    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Faces are rich sources of information, playing a key role in human social perception. They strongly draw attention, serving as a primary means of person recognition and informing social inferences (e.g., Young & Burton, 2017; Zebrowitz, 2010<!--others?-->). Various subfields within psychology—including vision science, person perception, social cognition, affective science, behavioural science, and person recognition—address research questions involving faces and thus necessitate the use of face images as stimuli. Here, we introduce a novel face image database for research use. This database was collected as part of an international multi-lab collaboration and addresses various limitations of existing databases. Crucially, we take a transparent approach aligned with Open Science best practices and make openly available the reproducible protocol we followed to collect the images, enabling future expansion of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Existing face databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A wealth of face stimulus databases exists, created for various purposes. Many of these are available (see e.g., Workman & Chatterjee 2021 face image meta-database to search many of these) for research purposes allowing access to a broad variety of face stimuli, well-suited to address questions in a given subfield. For example, there are many different databases in which photographed individuals (referred to as targets or models) display different facial expressions of emotion (e.g., Ebner et al., 2010; van der Schalk et al., 2011; of use in affective science), appear in varying lighting and angles (e.g., Burton et al., 2010; Gao et al. 2008; useful for person recognition research), or belong to various age or racial/ethnic groups (for perception researcher). However, many studies tend to rely on a small number of those stimulus databases, which introduces potential problems. For example, 4107 published papers cite the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (Lundquist et al., 1998), 4375 cite the NimStim Set of Facial Expressions (Tottenham et al., 2009), 2461 cite the Chicago Face Database (Ma et al.), and 3219 the Radboud Faces Database (Langner et al., 2010). This frequent (over)use of the same sets of stimuli can compromise generalizability when various research questions are tested on only a limited sample of face images (DeBruine et al., 2022; Yarkoni, 2022). Participants, especially those participating online, may also become familiar with frequently used stimuli, potentially introducing biases to their responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, not all research involving face images uses stimuli from published databases. It is a common for researchers to purposefully collect images themselves. But these stimulus sets are seldom openly shared (e.g., due to ethical limitations). Although this circumvents the issues with frequently-used databases, it introduces its own set of problems. Chiefly, face images collected by researchers for their own research use are often insufficiently documented. Although the resulting images may be described and/or illustrated with an example, the process of image collection is rarely described in adequate detail. This is often the case for even those databases openly available for research use. This lack of image acquisition (and processing) methods documentation limits transparency, replication attempts (for example, another researcher attempting to replicate a finding using new face images collected themselves, rather than the images collected by the original researchers; see Třebický et al. 2024) and ultimately comparisons of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many databases (both publicly available and not), there are also limitations in the diversity of stimuli. For example, many include images of only White or Western targets/models (e.g., see Cook & Over 2021). This reinforces the centering of Whiteness and Western culture in psychological research, importantly limiting the ecological validity and generalizability of conclusions (see also Henrich et al., 2010). Recently created databases have sought to address this, specifically collecting images of multiracial/multi-ethnic and non-Western samples, for example (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Meyers et al., 2024; Saribay et al., 2018; Trzewik et al., 2025), but more such work is needed to further diversify the pool of available face research stimuli. Many world regions remain underrepresented . This may be due, in part, to resource limitations: Equipment and setups for collecting images suitable for research use can be prohibitively expensive and complex, making database collection not feasible for everyone and everywhere, thereby limiting database diversity. Additionally, researchers with the necessary equipment may be limited in terms of the diversity of their available participant sample. Furthermore, to date, no extant database contains images of individuals from *multiple* world regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final limitation of extant face image databases is their largely static state. That is, once collected, the number of stimuli available does not change. There are some exceptions to this, such as multiple waves of additions to the Chicago Face Database (Lakshmi et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021). Continued additions to databases are not the norm, however. This not only constrains the number of stimuli in any given database, increasing the likelihood of the frequent reuse of any individual stimulus, but can also render some databases obsolete over time (e.g., due to very dated model appearance/styling).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Open Science considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Open and transparent methods are essential for fully understanding, evaluating, and replicating research. Although methods reporting has become more open and accessible with researchers sharing materials such as questionnaire wording, stimuli, and programming scripts, the reporting of face image database collection procedures often lacks crucial details for full transparency and reproducibility. This matters because differences in details such as focal length, for example, can importantly affect faces’ appearance, subsequently impacting perceptions of them (e.g., Třebický et al. 2016; see Třebický et al. 2024 for further discussion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Team Science (i.e., multi-lab) endeavours and large-scale collaborations are now recognized as a vital part of improving science. Within psychology, multiple such initiatives have importantly contributed to addressing a variety of research questions, improving diversity and generalizability in the field (e.g., in the domain of face perception, Jones et al.’s 2021 Psychological Science Accelerator project). Such an approach has yet to be applied to stimulus database collection, but it represents an opportunity to address many of the limitations of face image databases raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The current work\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we sought to address the limitations of existing face image databases through a Big Team Science approach. This served as the first project of ManyFaces, an international consortium of face perception and recognition researchers formed in 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address transparency and reproducibility issues, we developed an openly available, reproducible protocol for face image collection. The protocol covers collecting multiple images (varying in standardization, viewing angle, and facial expression) of each target/model to benefit a wide array of possible research areas and questions related to face perception and recognition. Following this protocol, we collected images (Phase 1) in 20 different labs across the world, spanning 11 countries and five world regions (Europe, Latin America, North America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia). This resulted in a diverse set of models and images, more than would be possible to collect in or by a single lab. Moreover, this database is not static but can be added to in the future by any interested researcher following the protocol. We also validated the database (Phase 2) by recruiting online perceivers to rate a subset of the images (i.e., front-facing images) to generate norming data for key social trait perceptions and emotion recognition. We make this image database and norming data available for future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Altogether, we introduce a new, diverse, openly-available face stimulus set that cancontinue to grow in the future. We believe that this effort will broaden the generalizability of findings in face perception and recognition research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Study/phase 1: Protocol development & stimulus collection\n",
    "\n",
    "To set face perception and recognition Big Team Science in motion and enable conducting multi-site studies, a set of stimuli suitable for most areas (e.g., in terms of research question, geographic location) is needed. Therefore, we developed a protocol allowing us to collect such a database of face images. We developed the protocol with maximum usability and accessibility in mind, making it transparent and readable to non-experts, and designed for use with attainable (vs. highly specialized and expensive) equipment, with minimal setup requirements, and without requiring expertise in photography. Note that the protocol is for in-lab image collection to minimize external noise, to enable the collection of models’ self-report data, and to ensure the consensual use of models’ images (vs. scraping images from online sources or generating them). Photographing faces in a controlled lab environment thus strikes a balance in terms of ecological validity and ethical concerns (see Trzewik et al., 2025, for discussion of the value of lab-photographed vs. artificially generated and ambient face images).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Method\n",
    "\n",
    "For both studies/phases, the University of Glasgow provided ethical approval. We obtained additional local ethical approval at collaborating institutions where required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Protocol Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The team curated a set of equipment and developed a protocol for collecting standardized, reproducible images of faces for research. Following a survey among the ManyFaces members, we constructed the protocol for the collection of a variety of images that would be useful for a broad variety of research questions. Specifically, we included images varying in their standardization of appearance (standardized and unstandardized, e.g., white t-shirt and hair pulled back vs. clothing and hair as worn by the participant/model on that day), viewing angle (frontal, profile, ¾), and facial expression (neutral, natural, angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, surprised).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to beginning data collection, the ManyFaces team pre-tested the protocol to ensure clarity of instructions and consistency of images collected across sites. We revised the protocol to address issues that arose (e.g., revised facial expression elicitation instructions, clarified camera settings). The final protocol can be found at \\[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9TPGXCgTRZi7nqEIg6jb42R4gNQx9L3qasg8tFvu1I/edit?usp=sharing<!--to add to OSF-->\\] (note that this is a living document that may be updated in future). In sum, the protocol detailed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.1.1 Image Types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol defined the categories of images in terms of their standardisation of appearance, viewing angle, and facial expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Standardisation of Appearance. In the *standardised* images, models wore a white crew neck t-shirt, had their hair pulled back or covered, included no adornments/accessories (excepting those that could not be removed for cultural reasons), and wore minimal or no makeup (models were informed about this beforehand). In contrast, *unstandardised* images showed models in their own clothing, with their hair as they came into the lab, and with adornments, except for glasses or anything that obscured the face or neck.  \n",
    "-   Viewing Angle. *Full frontal portraits* showed models facing the camera, *left and right profile portraits* showed each side of models’ faces in profile, and *left and right ¾ portraits* showed models’ faces at a 45-degree angle from the axis of the camera.  \n",
    "-   Facial Expression. *Neutral* images were of models refraining from making any facial expression, *natural* images displayed a natural expression for the model, and each facial expression of emotion displayed the expression the model would make if they were feeling the specified emotion (e.g., happiness).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.1.2 Image Prioritisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol specified which images to take (i.e., the combinations of appearance standardisation, viewing angle, and facial expression), in what order, and which were most crucial to collect (as voted by the ManyFaces members) if researchers were under time constraints. The order of image collection was as follows, with starred (\\*) images prioritised/required for each model:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Exposure calibration photo\\*\n",
    "-   Identification & calibration photo\\*\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Natural - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Neutral - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Neutral - Left and Right profile portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Neutral - Left and Right ¾ portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Happy - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Happy - Left and Right profile portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Happy - Left and Right ¾ portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - All other expressions (in random or appropriate order) - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "-   Standardized - Natural - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "-   Standardized - Neutral - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Neutral - Left and Right profile portraits\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Neutral - Left and Right ¾ portraits\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Happy - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Happy - Left and Right profile portraits\n",
    "-   Standardized - Happy - Left and Right ¾ portraits\n",
    "-   Standardized - All other expressions (in random or appropriate order) - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers with additional time could also capture the other expressions at different viewing angles (Left/Right profile, ¾) with either unstandardized or standardized appearance, as well as a video of standardized appearance to test out 3D image capture.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.1 The value of the current work\n",
    "\n",
    "This database provides a uniquely diverse face image stimulus set in terms of model nationality and image variety (appearance standardization, viewing angle, and facial expression). The diversity of images within the database makes it potentially useful to address a variety of research questions in multiple subfields of psychology (e.g., face recognition, emotion). It accomplishes this while being transparent and reproducible via the openly available protocol. Additionally, the database need not remain static: Other researchers can follow the protocol and add to the database, further increasing its sample size and diversity. This protocol can also serve as a template for researchers interested in collecting stimulus images, in terms of highlighting the kinds of details that need to be considered and documented)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data associated with the images are also valuable. First, we collected models’ self-reported demographic information, which is useful for various kinds of research questions. The validation/norming data we collected also provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in using the images, for example enabling researchers to choose subsets of images most suited to address their research questions. These data also provide information about the minimum number of raters needed for reliable mean ratings for different judgments (see Hehman et al., 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "This work also provides proof of concept that various labs, all following the same protocol and using the same equipment, can take comparable images to form a coherent face database. This broadens opportunities for future image database collection: A database does not need to all be collected by one lab in one location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Reflections on the Process & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The leadership team found that having a broad variety of areas of expertise and diverse research backgrounds within the broader team was invaluable in both developing the database and in troubleshooting issues. We moreover found that setting out expectations at the start of the project through a collaboration agreement was essential. However, we ran into various issues throughout the process, which are common to Big Team Science initiatives. For example, with so many labs and individual researchers involved, timelines for completion necessarily stretched. This made momentum difficult to maintain at times. Planning in generous buffer time for such large-scale projects and managing team members’ expectations around timelines is therefore essential. We also faced difficulty in finding an optimal way to communicate effectively with all team members, given varying preferences (e.g., via email vs. other team communication platforms). It is perhaps worth surveying members of a big team at project start about communication possibilities, as well as outlining more specific communication expectations in a collaboration agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Phase 1, we surveyed the ManyFaces research team to provide feedback on the process of collecting images using the protocol. Team members commonly expressed the desire for additional concise guidance in following the protocol, including an additional abbreviated protocol with numbered steps to follow during data collection and a video tutorial (in addition to the provided illustrative images) showing the necessary steps for researchers unfamiliar with camera equipment. These are requests that we can incorporate into future protocol updates. Doing so could both make the process easier for researchers and minimize errors and deviations from the protocol, ensuring greater consistency between sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major issue raised by the research team was the difficulty of eliciting facial expressions as described in the protocol. The protocol took a straightforward instructive approach to emotion elicitation (e.g., asking participants to face the camera with the expression they would make if they were feeling happy), following consultation with emotion experts in ManyFaces and discussion of feasibility with the wider team. However, models self-reported difficulty with the facial expression posing, in line with researchers’ feedback. The emotion validation data also indicate that models struggled to pose the facial expressions of emotion. The data furthermore suggest that perceivers had difficulty identifying emotions from these posed facial expressions. In support of this idea, recent research shows posed expressions to not appear genuine and reveals differing perceptions of posed and spontaneous expressions (Dawel et al., 2017, 2025). Future work, including possible updates to our own protocol, may therefore focus on developing a better framework to elicit facial expressions. This could include taking inspiration from databases of naturally-induced emotion (e.g., Miolla et al., 2023; Sneddon et al., 2011) and considering potential cultural differences and specific local needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research team also raised several comments about the provided and not-provided equipment, specifically the flimsiness of the light stand and the missing standardized backdrop (due to shipping constraints, participating researchers were to source a white background, e.g., a wall, seamless fabric, or paper). It is worth highlighting that the images were captured with equipment selected due to several practical constraints: budget, university-approved vendors, shipping logistics, interoperability, and ease of use for non-experts in varying conditions. The available project budget and administrative restrictions on approved vendors (their offerings and stock) for the University of Glasgow primarily limited the attainable camera, lens, and lighting setup. In general, we opted to create a setup that would not be prohibitively expensive to acquire, could be shipped in a single parcel, and would be compatible (substitutable) with equipment other researchers may have available. The last consideration was creating a setup with the fewest degrees of freedom, and thus less room for error. Therefore, we opted to use an LED ring light with a camera mounted inside the ring in landscape orientation on a single stand (vs. portrait orientation using a different kind of mount or separate stands for the camera and light). Ring lights became ubiquitous and easy to acquire in recent years; they only need to be positioned square, level, and in front of the sitter. Other, more complex setups can be created; however, the price, mobility, and repeatability of such setups may represent major constraints to consistent and reliable image collection. It is therefore worth considering trade-offs between different kinds of equipment and setups in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to our choices of equipment, we also made certain pragmatic choices during image processing that future work could improve on. For example, we white-balanced the images rather than fully colour-correcting them, as we were able to create a fully reproducible scripted method for the former process, but not the latter. This was due to limitations such as varied colour checker chart placement and orientation in models’ photos and a lack of expertise on the research team to work around this in a reproducible way. We therefore opted to simply white-balance to keep the process entirely open and reproducible, rather than fully colour-correct using a manual and not fully reproducible method. The process of aligning and sizing the images was also driven by cropping needs. That is, due to the landscape orientation of the photos, there was limited vertical space that we could crop, constraining the possibilities for face alignment and image size. Future work could consider using alternative equipment setups to enable capture images in portrait mode. Variation in faces’ size in the images, due to some deviations from the distances specified in the protocol, also affected the image processing steps. This could be addressed in future work by more clearly highlighting not only the key aspects of the protocol that should be kept constant, but also why these aspects should be constant (i.e., clarifying the reasoning to all team members).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we collected images of 211 models, but no single image type included images of all models. Rather, the maximum number of models represented in a single image type was 205 images (standardized neutral, front-facing). This led to missing perceived age/ethnicity data for six models who had unstandardized but not standardized neutral images available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce a new diverse face image database, which will be useful to researchers interested in a variety of questions related to social perception, person recognition, and vision science. We demonstrate that a cohesive database can be compiled across a variety of sites, opening doors for future additions to this database and the development of future multi-lab databases."
